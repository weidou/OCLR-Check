The traces used for evaluating MonPoly 1.1.2 are generated by the python script *trace_transform_monpoly.py*, which can be executed in a folder containing traces in the XMI format.

The *MFOTL* folder contains 12 temporal formulae written in MFOTL corresponding to the OCLR properties P1-P12.

The 12 temporal properties written in OCLR are shown as below.
--
P1: globally always a;
P2: globally never b;
P3: globally eventually at least 2 a;
P4: globally eventually at most 3 a;
P5: globally a responding at most 1000 tu b;
P6: globally a responding exactly 1000 tu b;
P7: globally a preceding at most 6000 tu b;
P8: globally a preceding at least 100 tu b;
P9: globally a preceding exactly 100 tu b;
P10: globally a, b preceding at least 1000 tu c, d;
P11: globally a responding at least 1000 tu b, c;
P12: globally a responding b;

For ease of use, the signatures which can be generated by the script are provided in the *signature* folder and the traces can be downloaded from the release: https://github.com/weidou/OCLR-Check/releases/tag/v1.3-monpoly-data
