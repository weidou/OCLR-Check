The traces used for evaluating MonPoly 1.1.2 are generated by the python script *trace_transform_monpoly.py*, which can be executed in a folder containing traces in the XMI format.

The *MFOTL* folder contains 12 temporal formulae written in MFOTL corresponding to the OCLR properties P1-P12.

For ease of use, the signatures which can be generated by the script are provided in the *signature* folder and the traces can be downloaded from the release: https://github.com/weidou/OCLR-Check/releases/tag/v1.3-monpoly-data
