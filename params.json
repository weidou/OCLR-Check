The other Java program *ConstraintFactory.java* is an auxiliary class for building OCL constraints and/or queries.\r\n  * The *models* folder contains three Ecore models: a *trace* model, an *OCLR* meta model, and a *check* model. By using the three models, we generate the corresponding Java code and check the traces with our *checker* programs.\r\n  * the *DSLs* folder contains the Xtext definitions (*Trace.xtext* and *Oclr.xtext*) of the trace model and of the *OCLR* meta model. It also contains the programs for building XMI instances of the two models.\r\n  * The *oclr2ocl* folder contains the definition of the translation that maps *OCLR* constraints into OCL constraints on the trace model.\r\n\r\n###Evaluation\r\nThis module contains the artifacts used to perform the evaluation described in the aforementioned technical report:\r\nthe *OCLR* properties and the trace generators used to generate the traces.\r\n\r\n* #####Properties\r\nWe provide 38 *OCLR* properties, both as DSL specifications (under the *OCLR-DSL-specifications* folder) and as XMI instances (under the *OCLR-XMI-instances* folder) conforming to the *OCLR* meta model. These XMI instances are generated from the DSL specifications by using the program: \"/checker/DSLs/OCLRInstanceFactory.java\".\r\n\r\n* #####Trace Generators\r\nTraces generator programs implement various generation strategies, depending on the type of property that one wants to check on the trace being generated.\r\nGenerators are Python programs named after the type of property for which they generate traces;  e.g., *trace_generator_globally.py* is the trace generator to generate the trace for the properties with the ```globally``` scope.\r\nA trace generator needs 4 parameters: \r\n  1. scope (```--scope/-s SCOPE```);\r\n  2. pattern (```--pattern/-p PATTERN```);\r\n  3. property id (```--id/-i ID```);\r\n  4. (maximum) trace length (```--length/-l LENGTH```). \r\n  For instance:\r\n  ```./trace_generator_globally.py -s 'globally' -p  'always a' -i p1 -l 1000000```\r\n  corresponds to generating traces with various trace lengths - 100K, 200K, ..., 1M (determined by the given maximum trace length) for the property with id ```p1``` which has the scope ```globally``` and the pattern ```always a```.\r\nWe also provide the shell scripts used to generate the traces for the 38 properties contained in the releases.\r\n\r\n* #####Traces\r\nFor each property to check, we provide several traces both in CSV and XMI formats. The XMI traces were generated by the trace generators introduced below, and the CSV traces were automatically transformed from the XMI ones. To keep the size of the repository small, we provide the traces in separate releases (https://github.com/weidou/OCLR-Check/releases/tag/v1.0-csv and https://github.com/weidou/OCLR-Check/releases/tag/v1.0-xmi).\r\n#Usage\r\nPlease follow the steps below to set up the environment for the trace checker.\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Java Project named \"lu.svv.offline\" and click __Finish__ (Please use this name, otherwise, you have to modify the code).\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot1](http://i58.tinypic.com/2ilzbir.jpg)\r\n2. Copy the folder \"/check/models/\" (in this repository) to the Java project.\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot2](http://i60.tinypic.com/2s7uzh4.jpg)\r\n3. Choose the file \"check.ecore\" in Eclipse and then create an __EMF Generator Model__ named \"check.genmodel\" by following the steps below.\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot3](http://i59.tinypic.com/2pqt8wo.jpg)\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot4](http://i60.tinypic.com/fjfbqx.jpg)\r\n\r\n  Choose __Ecore model__ and click __Next__.\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot5](http://i62.tinypic.com/zv75hw.jpg)\r\n\r\n  Load the model \"check.ecore\" and click __Next__.\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot6](http://i59.tinypic.com/2py6ki0.jpg)\r\n\r\n  Click __Select All__ at the upper right and click __Finish__.\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot7](http://i61.tinypic.com/2hqb612.jpg)\r\n\r\n4. Open \"check.genmodel\" with the __EMF Generator__, choose the second, nested occurrence of \"Check\"\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot8](http://i59.tinypic.com/120grpv.jpg)\r\n  \r\n  and make the following changes.\r\n  Open the __Properties__ view from the Menu (__Window > Show View > Properties__) and fill the __Base Package__ with \"lu.svv.offline\".\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot9](http://i57.tinypic.com/x1avdy.jpg)\r\n\r\n  Choose \"Trace\" in \"check.genmodel\" and fill the __Base Package__ with \"lu.svv.offline\".\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot10](http://i58.tinypic.com/2dkmnir.jpg)\r\n\r\n  Choose \"Oclr\" in \"check.genmodel\" and fill the __Base Package__ with \"lu.svv.offline\".\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot11](http://i59.tinypic.com/2iw97hh.jpg)\r\n\r\n5. Choose the first (outer) \"Check\" instance and right-click on it. Choose __Generate Model Code__ from the pop-up menu.\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot12](http://i61.tinypic.com/2v169gx.jpg)\r\n\r\n6. Once generating the model code, copy the two files under \"/checker/main/\" (in this repository) to the Eclipse package \"/src/lu.svv.offline.check/\".\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot13](http://i60.tinypic.com/fwojux.jpg)\r\n\r\n  If you find errors about missing packages in the Java files, open the files, click on the errors and choose the last option __Fix project setup...__. The missing packages will be added into the __Plug-in Dependencies__.\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot14](http://i59.tinypic.com/10ege2f.jpg)\r\n\r\n7. Create a new folder named \"lib\" in the project and copy the file \"/checker/oclr2ocl/oclr.ocl\" (in this repository) to the new folder \"lib\".\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot15](http://i62.tinypic.com/14y0jg1.jpg)\r\n\r\n  You may get errors if you open \"oclr.ocl\" with the __CompletOCL Editor__. The OCL code is correct; however, the editor cannot identify the models elements in the code. (If you uncomment the three lines at the top of the file, errors will disappear. However, keep these three lines commented, otherwise the checker programs will not work).\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot16](http://i58.tinypic.com/28co9lg.jpg)\r\n\r\n8. Create a new folder named \"instances\" in the project and copy the properties you'd like to test under the folder \"/evaluation/properties/OCLR-XMI-instances\"  and the corresponding traces under the folder \"/evaluation/traces/XMI/\" (You need to unzip the files to get traces).\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot17](http://i61.tinypic.com/6f147q.jpg)\r\n\r\n9. The project will look like this (The error of the project is from the OCL file. Please ignore it):\r\n\r\n  ![screenshot18](http://i59.tinypic.com/246m4v7.jpg)\r\n\r\n10. Invoke the test methods in the *main* method of \"OfflineCheck.java\". The usage of the methods is explained in the code comments.\r\n","google":"UA-54392714-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
