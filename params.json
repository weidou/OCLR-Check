The tools have been developed by Wei Dou (http://people.svv.lu/dou) and maintained by Wei and Domenico Bianculli (http://people.svv.lu/bianculli) at the SVV lab (http://www.svv.lu) of the University of Luxembourg (http://wwwen.uni.lu).

The syntax and semantics of *OCLR* have been introduced in this paper: \"Wei Dou, Domenico Bianculli, and Lionel Briand. __OCLR: a more expressive, pattern-based temporal extension of OCL__.

Springer, July 2014.\"\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n---\r\n* Mac OS X / Linux\r\n* Xtext framework (http://xtext.org) 2.5.0+\r\n* Java 1.6.0_65\r\n* Eclipse OCL 4.1.0\r\n\r\nContent of the bundle\r\n---\r\nThe OCLR-Check distribution contains two modules:\r\n\r\n###Checker\r\nThe offline trace checker is comprised of four parts: the OCLR-Check main programs, the models, the DSLs, and the mapping from *OCLR* to OCL.\r\n  * In the *main* folder, *OfflineCheck.java* is the main program of checking the *OCLR* properties, which provides all the evaluation functions (e.g., *check_globally()*) in accordance with the evaluation section of the technical report. The other Java program *ConstraintFactory.java* is an auxiliary class for building OCL constraints and/or queries, namely the OCL templates for checking *OCLR* properties are defined in this program.\r\n  * The *models* contains three Ecore models: a trace model, an *OCLR* meta model, and a check model. By using the three models, we generate the corresponding Java codes and check the traces with our main programs. The description of the first two models can be found in the technical report. The check model defines a class called *Monitor*, which consists of a set of references to the *Trace* class defined in the Trace model and a set of references to the *OCLRConstraint* class defined in the *OCLR* meta model.\r\n  * In fact, the trace model and the *OCLR* meta model above are generated by the Xtext definitions in the *DSLs* folder (*Trace.xtext* and *Oclr.xtext*). We also provide the programs for building XMI instances of the two models.\r\n  * The translation from *OCLR* to OCL are defined as OCL operations in *oclr2ocl*, which is invoked by the main programs for trace checking.\r\n\r\nTo run the OCLR-Check main programs, you have to build a Java project in Xtext, and generate java codes with the models. Once the project is ready, you need to add the *OCLR* translation and the main programs into the project, you may need to change the package names in these codes to adapt the new environment.\r\n\r\n###Evaluation\r\nThis module contains *OCLR* properties, traces and trace generators that generate those traces.\r\n\r\n* #####Properties\r\nWe provide 38 *OCLR* properties with both their DSL specifications and XMI instances with respect to the *OCLR* meta model. In fact, those XMI instances are generated from the DSL specifications by using the program: \"/checker/DSLs/OCLRInstanceFactory.java\".\r\n\r\n* #####Traces\r\nTo check different properties, different traces are generated. They are grouped by property scopes - *globally* (p1-p12), *before* (p13-p20), *after* (p21-p31), *between-and* (p32-38).\r\n\r\n* #####Trace Generators\r\nFor different scopes, the trace generators are implemented with different generation strategies. We will not explain again the details about the strategies (they can be found in the evaluation section of the technical report), but we will briefly introduce how to use the scripts (\\*.py and \\*.sh).\r\n  * Each Python program (\\*.py) is actually a trace generator which can be distinguished by its name, e.g., *trace_generator_globally.py* is the trace generator to generate the trace for the properties with the *globally* scope. A trace generator needs 4 parameters: 1). scope. 2). pattern. 3). property id. 4). (maximum) trace length. For instance:\r\n  ```./trace_generator_globally.py -s 'globally' -p  'always a' -i p1 -l 1000000```\r\n  * A Shell script (\\*.sh) is used to generate traces automatically for each strategy by invoking the same Python program with different parameters.\r\n","google":"UA-54392714-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
