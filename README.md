Welcome to OCLR-Check
==========

OCLR-Check is a toolset to perform offline checking of *OCLR* properties on system execution traces. The toolset has been developed by Wei Dou (http://people.svv.lu/dou), at the SVV lab (http://www.svv.lu) of the University of Luxembourg (http://wwwen.uni.lu).
More information on OCLR-Check is available in this technical report:

*OCLR* is a temporal extension of OCL (Object Constraint Language, http://www.omg.org/spec/OCL) which allows users to express temporal properties using property specification patterns (http://patterns.projects.cis.ksu.edu). *OCLR* has been introduced in this paper:

Requirements
---
* Mac OS X / Linux
* Xtext framework (http://xtext.org) 2.5.0+
* Java 1.6.0_65
* Eclipse OCL 4.1.0

Content of the distribution
---
The OCLR-Check distribution contains two modules:

###Checker (*checker* folder)
The offline trace checker is comprised of four parts: the OCLR-Check main programs, the models, the DSLs, and the mapping from *OCLR* to OCL.
  * In the *main* folder, *OfflineCheck.java* is the main program for checking *OCLR* properties. The other Java program *ConstraintFactory.java* is an auxiliary class for building OCL constraints and/or queries.
  * The *models* folder contains three Ecore models: a *trace* model, an *OCLR* meta model, and a *check* model. By using the three models, we generate the corresponding Java code and check the traces with our *checker* programs.
  * the *DSLs* folder contains the Xtext definitions (*Trace.xtext* and *Oclr.xtext*) of the trace model and of the *OCLR* meta model. It also contains the programs for building XMI instances of the two models.
  * The *oclr2ocl* folder contains the definition of the translation that maps *OCLR* constraints into OCL constraints on the trace model.

###Evaluation
This module contains the artifacts used to perform the evaluation described in the aforementioned technical report:
*OCLR* properties, traces, and the trace generators used to generate the traces.

* #####Properties
We provide 38 *OCLR* properties, both as DSL specifications (under the *OCLR-DSL-specifications* folder) and as XMI instances (under the *OCLR-XMI-instances* folder) conforming to the *OCLR* meta model. These XMI instances are generated from the DSL specifications by using the program: "/checker/DSLs/OCLRInstanceFactory.java".

* #####Traces
For each property to check, we provide several traces both in CSV (for public use, under the *CSV* foler) and XMI formats (under the *XMI* folder). The XMI traces are generated by the trace generators introduced below, and the CSV traces are transformed from the XMI ones. For the reason of maximum file size limit in GitHub, we zip up the XMI files and group them by property scopes: ```globally``` (p1-p12), ```before``` (p13-p20), ```after``` (p21-p31), ```between-and``` (p32-38).

* #####Trace Generators
Traces generator programs implement various generation strategies, depending on the type of property that one wants to check on the trace being generated.
Generators are Python programs named after the type of property for which they generate traces;  e.g., *trace_generator_globally.py* is the trace generator to generate the trace for the properties with the ```globally``` scope.
A trace generator needs 4 parameters: 1). scope (```--scope/-s SCOPE```). 2). pattern (```--pattern/-p PATTERN```). 3). property id (```--id/-i ID```). 4). (maximum) trace length (```--length/-l LENGTH```). For instance:
  ```./trace_generator_globally.py -s 'globally' -p  'always a' -i p1 -l 1000000```
  corresponds to generating traces with various trace lengths - 100K, 200K, ..., 1M (determined by the given maximum trace length) for the property ```p1``` which has the scope ```globally``` and the pattern ```always a```.
We also provide the shell scripts used to generate the traces for the 38 properties contained in the distribution.

#Usage
Please follow the steps below to set up the environment for the trace checker.

1. Create a new Java Project named "lu.svv.offline" and click __Finish__ (Please use this name, otherwise, you have to modify the codes).

2. Copy the folder "/check/models/" (in this repository) to the Java project.

  ![screenshot2](http://i60.tinypic.com/2s7uzh4.jpg)
3. Choose the file "check.ecore" in Eclipse and then create an __EMF Generator Model__ named "check.genmodel" by following the steps below.

  ![screenshot3](http://i59.tinypic.com/2pqt8wo.jpg)

  ![screenshot4](http://i60.tinypic.com/fjfbqx.jpg)

  Choose __Ecore model__ and click __Next__.

  ![screenshot5](http://i62.tinypic.com/zv75hw.jpg)

  Load the model "check.ecore" and click __Next__.

  ![screenshot6](http://i59.tinypic.com/2py6ki0.jpg)

  Click __Select All__ at the upper right and click __Finish__.

  ![screenshot7](http://i61.tinypic.com/2hqb612.jpg)

4. Open "check.genmodel" with the __EMF Generator__, choose the second "Check", and make the following changes.

  ![screenshot8](http://i59.tinypic.com/120grpv.jpg)

  Open the __Properties__ view from the Menu (__Window > Show View > Properties__) and fill the __Base Package__ with "lu.svv.offline".

  ![screenshot9](http://i57.tinypic.com/x1avdy.jpg)

  Choose "Trace" in "check.genmodel" and fill the __Base Package__ with "lu.svv.offline".

  ![screenshot10](http://i58.tinypic.com/2dkmnir.jpg)

  Choose "Oclr" in "check.genmodel" and fill the __Base Package__ with "lu.svv.offline".

  ![screenshot11](http://i59.tinypic.com/2iw97hh.jpg)

5. Choose the first "Check" and right-click on it. Choose __Generate Model Code__ from the pop-up menu.

  ![screenshot12](http://i61.tinypic.com/2v169gx.jpg)

6. Once generating the model code, copy the two files under "/checker/main/" (in this repository) to the Eclipse package "/src/lu.svv.offline.check/".

  ![screenshot13](http://i60.tinypic.com/fwojux.jpg)

  If you find errors about missing packages in the Java files, open the files, click on the errors and choose the last option __Fix project setup...__. The missing packages will be added into the __Plug-in Dependencies__.

  ![screenshot14](http://i59.tinypic.com/10ege2f.jpg)

7. Create a new folder named "lib" in the project and copy the file "/checker/oclr2ocl/oclr.ocl" (in this repository) to the new folder "lib".

  ![screenshot15](http://i62.tinypic.com/14y0jg1.jpg)

  You may get errors if you open "oclr.ocl" with the __CompletOCL Editor__. The OCL codes are correct. It is just because the editor cannot identify the models elements in the code. (If you uncomment the three lines at the top of the file, errors will disappear. But please comment these three lines, otherwise the checker programs will not work).

  ![screenshot16](http://i58.tinypic.com/28co9lg.jpg)

8. Create a new folder named "instances" in the project and copy the properties you'd like to test under the folder "/evaluation/properties/OCLR-XMI-instances" (in this repository) and the corresponding traces under the folder "/evaluation/traces/XMI/" (You need to unzip the files to get traces).

  ![screenshot17](http://i61.tinypic.com/6f147q.jpg)

9. You will see the project like this (The error of the project is from the ocl file. Please ignore it):

  ![screenshot18](http://i59.tinypic.com/246m4v7.jpg)

10. Please invoke the test methods in the *main* method of "OfflineCheck.java". The usage of the methods are embedded in the code comments.
